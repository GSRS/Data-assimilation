Introducation:
SWAT-HDAS is to achieve a fast, easy-to-use, and multidisciplinary application-oriented assimilation platform.SWAT-HDAS integrates many algorithms (including diverse Kalman filters). Using parallel computing technologies (OpenMP), SWAT-HDAS can assimilate various land surface variables and remote sensing observations. SWAT-HDAS can be applied in multidisciplinary data assimilation studies.
